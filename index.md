 An open-source DEM simulation system named ***REATICLE*** for granular materials, is a fork of open-source impulse-based physics engine [**Bullet3**](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3), which is carried out on open-source 3D creation suite [**Blender**](https://github.com/sobotka/blender) platform
  The main features are: 
* arbitrarily shaped particlesâ€™ frictions and collisions were unified in one linear complementarity problem. 
* **Real-time AABB Tree contact detection is updated with mirror-enhanced algorithm.** 
* **Multiple-data operation system is improved with Python API including velocity, force, location, orientation and contact number.**
* advanced computer technology is adopted for fast and stable simulation, that is, CPU Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 (SS2) for core dynamics computation and GPU compute unified device architecture (CUDA 8.0) for 3D creating and rendering.
